# SVHN Classification Project

## Description
This project involves classifying images from the SVHN (Street View House Numbers) dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits in street view images.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

You can install these packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup
Clone this repository.
Install the required packages as mentioned above.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook SVHN_Classification.ipynb
Files Included
SVHN_Classification.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook with the model training and evaluation code.
svhn_cnn_model.h5: Trained model file.
dataset.h5: Dataset file used for training.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies for the project.
